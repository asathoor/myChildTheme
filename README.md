# myChildTheme

This is a childtheme demonstration. In this case the parent theme is Twenty Twenty-five - but it's easy to change to another theme. Just edit the `style.css`file, and copy relevant files from the parent theme to the child theme folder.

## Structure

These files will initiate your theme development process. Now you can add whatever you fancy: fonts, colors, duotones, gradients, headers, templates, etc. etc.
